<p class="info">
Simpsonaator is a simple question-based game where the computer tries to guess which character from the TV show Simpsons the user is thinking of.
The program asks the user a series of questions, such as "Is your character a human?" or "Does your character have brown hair?", and based on the answers, it tries to guess who the user has in mind.
<br>I made the project for the final assessment of a Java programming course. Source of inspiration: <a href="https://en.akinator.com/" target="_blank">Akinator</a>.
