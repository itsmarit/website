<p class="info">I absolutely hate having to open up Google every day just to search for the electricity prices.
I also cannot be bothered to read news from five different news portals every day (but I do like to get my information from several sources - to get a better overview of what is happening in the world, as well as see news from specific fields that interest me, like tech).
That's why I made an application that can be accessed directly from the desktop with one click. It shows me all the info I need: the electricity prices for the next 24 hours and the top news from the sources of my own choice.
Kohvipaus is available in two versions - night (black, purple tones) and latte (beige, brown).</p>
